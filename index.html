      <p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rae Wiechens. I'm from St. Louis, currently living in Columbia, IL with my fiancÃ© and two bunnies; Bilbo and Serene. For the past 4 years or so, I've worked full time and freelance as a graphic designer. I've dabbled with code off and on since around 2019. One of the challenges I've faced as self-taught designer is standing out in a competetive market that often over looks candidates that don't possess a college degree. My goal is to gain the technical skill-set, confindence and network of like-minded individuals to help me make the move into full-stack developement. I'd especially love to work as a front-end developer or ux/ui designer & developer. </p>
